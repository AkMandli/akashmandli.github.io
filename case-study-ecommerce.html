          <p>
            A mid-market software and hardware solutions company with <strong>$19.2 million in annual revenue</strong> and a 200-person workforce was losing competitive ground — not because of its products, but because of the fragmented digital infrastructure holding its commerce operations together. Disconnected systems, manual workflows, an outdated CMS, and the absence of real-time data were creating friction at every stage of the customer journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Led engagement transformed this landscape. Through rigorous discovery, cross-functional stakeholder alignment, and meticulous requirements engineering, the project delivered a fully integrated WooCommerce and Salesforce ecosystem on WordPress — and with it, results that redefined the company's digital performance benchmarks.
          </p>
          <div class="cs-quote">
            <p>"Served as the connective tissue between what the business needed and what technology could deliver — ensuring every decision was grounded in data, stakeholder clarity, and commercial outcomes."</p>

          <h2 class="cs-section__title">Six Fault Lines in<br/>a Growing Business</h2>
          <p>
            The client's digital operations faced compounding challenges that were actively costing revenue and customer trust. Each gap, while identifiable in isolation, was deeply intertwined — creating a systemic problem that demanded strategic, not just technical, intervention.
          </p>
          <div class="cs-challenges">
            <div class="cs-challenge">
              <span class="cs-challenge__icon">▲</span>
              <p><strong>Fragmented system architecture</strong> — Disparate tools and platforms operated in silos, preventing any single source of operational truth across commerce, CRM, and fulfillment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cs-challenge">
              <span class="cs-challenge__icon">▲</span>
              <p><strong>No unified backend integration</strong> — Salesforce and fulfillment systems were unconnected, creating manual handoffs, data duplication, and costly reconciliation overhead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cs-challenge">
              <span class="cs-challenge__icon">▲</span>
              <p><strong>Zero real-time data sync</strong> — Orders, inventory levels, and quotes were subject to significant delays, undermining customer experience and operational agility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cs-challenge">
              <span class="cs-challenge__icon">▲</span>
              <p><strong>Performance and scalability bottlenecks</strong> — The existing Kontent.ai CMS was no longer fit for purpose, delivering slow page loads and a rigid structure ill-suited to commerce growth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cs-challenge">
              <span class="cs-challenge__icon">▲</span>
              <p><strong>Poor SEO architecture</strong> — A lack of structured content organisation and technical SEO hygiene limited organic discoverability at precisely the moment the business needed inbound growth.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cs-challenge">
              <span class="cs-challenge__icon">▲</span>
              <p><strong>Limited growth enablement</strong> — With no Cart-to-Quote functionality or B2B-ready commerce flows, the platform was unable to service the full breadth of the client's customer base effectively.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Without a Business Analyst capable of connecting stakeholder pain to system requirements, the transformation risked becoming a technology project in search of a strategy.</p>

          <div class="cs-section__num">03 — Discovery &amp; Analysis</div>
          <h2 class="cs-section__title">Listening Before Building:<br/>The Discovery Mandate</h2>
          <p>
            Initiated a structured discovery programme designed to surface not only what was broken, but <em>why</em> — and what the business truly needed rather than simply what had been assumed. This distinction became foundational to the project's success.

              <div class="cs-method__title">Operational Gap Analysis</div>

              <div class="cs-method__title">Feasibility Assessment</div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">This phase established the analytical foundation that guided every subsequent decision — ensuring the solution was scoped to solve the real problem, not just the most visible one.</p>

          <p>
            With discovery complete, taken responsibility for translating nuanced stakeholder needs into a precise, actionable specification set. This is where the strategic value of business analysis most clearly materialised — bridging the language of commerce and the logic of engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did not simply document what was requested. They challenged assumptions, interrogated edge cases, and ensured that <strong>every requirement was traceable to a defined business outcome.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>A comprehensive documentation suite was prepared to govern the build phase and eliminate ambiguity between teams:</p>
          <div class="cs-deliverables">
            <div class="cs-deliverable">Business Requirements Document (BRD)</div>

            <div class="cs-deliverable">Integration Requirements</div>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The high-level architecture design defined how WordPress, WooCommerce, and Salesforce would interact — establishing clear data ownership, event triggers, and synchronisation logic that would underpin the real-time integration. This artefact became the shared reference point for developers, QA engineers, and business stakeholders throughout delivery.</p>
